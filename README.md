# ProjectPegasus

Alex Burnley and Jason Cummings

Libraries: OpenGL, stb_image.h (Packaged with code), glm, Assimp


To make the program, use the command 'make'. Use './Pegasus' to run the program.

Currently, on our Linux VM, the lights in the scene are extremely bright, and we're not currently sure why this is happening. This will be fixed by the final submission of the program.
